Description: Tools to solve real-world problems with multiple classes classifications by computing the areas under ROC and PR curve via micro-averaging and macro-averaging. The vignettes of this package can be found via <https://github.com/WandeRum/multiROC>. The methodology is described in V. Van Asch (2013) <https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/~vincent/pdf/microaverage.pdf> and Pedregosa et al. (2011) <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_roc.html>.
